# CoScheduleCodingChallenge

To run the project cd on over to the directory that the project is housed in and then cd to the backend folder and either use node or nodemon to run the server.js file. This makes it able to fetch the data from the mongodb database. Then in another terminal cd back to the main directory and type "npm start" and it should take you to a browser to run the front end of the project.

Also just in case it wasn't apparent, you can click on the flame icons on the images. And when you do you can go on over to the DO NOT CLICK THIS BUTTON for a spicy surprise üòè.
